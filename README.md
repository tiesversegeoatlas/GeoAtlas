# GeoAtlas Backend Low Level Design

Project work history is maintained in [documentation.md](documentation.md). The runnable data-collection backend is in [backend/](backend/), implementation notes are in [docs/GEOATLAS_DATA_COLLECTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md](docs/GEOATLAS_DATA_COLLECTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md), the senior-facing commercialization proposal is in [docs/GEOATLAS_COMMERCIAL_API_PROPOSAL.md](docs/GEOATLAS_COMMERCIAL_API_PROPOSAL.md), and the detailed pricing, quota, SLA, and operations plan is in [docs/COMMERCIAL_API_PRODUCT_AND_PRICING.md](docs/COMMERCIAL_API_PRODUCT_AND_PRICING.md).

## 1. Backend Overview

GeoAtlas is a production backend for monitoring geo-intelligence, crisis, and conflict events from automated external sources and human analyst workflows. The backend owns authentication, authorization, event ingestion, analyst review, event publication, map-ready geospatial APIs, dashboards, watchlists, notifications, and auditability.

Core responsibilities:

| Area | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Authentication | Register users, authenticate credentials, issue JWT access tokens, rotate refresh tokens, revoke sessions, expose current-user context. |
| User and role management | Manage users, roles, permissions, account state, analyst/admin privileges, and superadmin-only controls. |
| Automatic data fetching | Fetch from configured RSS, news API, public dataset, government alert, NGO, and OSINT-style public sources on schedules. |
| GeoAtlas source collection | Provide a small internal interface for adding RSS/feed links, testing auto-detection, triggering ingestion, and previewing normalized output without building a public news frontend. |
| Source management | Store source endpoint, connector type, reliability score, fetch interval, rate limit, credentials reference, and status. |
| Raw data storage | Persist unmodified fetched payloads for traceability, replay, audits, and normalization debugging. |
| Data normalization | Convert source-specific payloads into a common normalized item format. |
| Event extraction | Extract title, summary, category, actors, location, dates, casualties, affected infrastructure, and source references. |
| Event deduplication | Compare normalized and extracted events against existing events and pending events. |
| Event management | Create, update, archive, verify, tag, source-link, and publish events. |
| Risk scoring | Suggest risk level using rule-based scoring plus confidence inputs from extraction. |
| Verification workflow | Route AI or connector-generated events into review, then require analyst/admin approval before publication. |
| Watchlists | Let users follow countries, regions, categories, keywords, actors, or individual events. |
| Intel clusters | Group related events into operational intelligence clusters. |
| Dashboard statistics | Provide aggregate counts, time series, high-risk alerts, ingestion health, and verification statistics. |
| Moderation | Support analyst/admin edits, approvals, rejections, merge decisions, and duplicate resolution. |
| AI assistance | Generate suggestions only: summaries, categories, locations, risk, timelines, duplicate likelihood, and confidence. |
| Map support | Store event coordinates, country/region metadata, bounding-box queries, and map marker payloads using Supabase Postgres + PostGIS. |
| Public standalone API | Expose versioned read-only output endpoints for normalized items, extracted event candidates, approved events, exports, OpenAPI docs, and health checks. |
| Notifications | Notify users about watchlist matches, high-risk events, review assignments, and ingestion failures. |
| Audit logging | Record immutable security, source, ingestion, review, verification, and event mutation activity. |
| Scheduled jobs | Register, lock, run, retry, and observe recurring source ingestion jobs. |

## 2. System Architecture

The backend uses layered FastAPI architecture with clear separation between request handling, business logic, persistence, ingestion, source-specific connectors, and background execution.

## 4. Automatic Data Fetching Design

Automatic fetching is a core backend capability. Source configuration drives scheduler registration, connector selection, rate limiting, retry behavior, and review routing.

### GeoAtlas Source Collection Module

GeoAtlas Data Collection is the first standalone data-collection slice of GeoAtlas. It lets an internal user add RSS or Atom feed links from a small frontend, while the backend performs feed detection, source validation, content extraction, normalization, geospatial hinting, and public API output.

This module deliberately does not require a public news-display frontend. The frontend only manages source addition and operational visibility. Consumers get output through JSON APIs, export endpoints, and OpenAPI documentation.

```text
Internal GeoAtlas Feed UI
  -> Add RSS/Atom URL
  -> Backend validates URL and blocks unsafe/private networks
  -> Backend detects feed type, title, site URL, language, favicon, and update cadence
  -> Source is saved in Supabase Postgres
  -> Scheduler or manual trigger fetches entries
  -> Raw payloads are stored unchanged
  -> Article content is extracted and normalized
  -> Locations/categories/entities/event candidates are detected
  -> Output is exposed through public API endpoints
```

Frontend scope:

| Screen | Controls | Backend APIs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add feed | URL input, source name override, reliability score, interval, enabled toggle | `POST /api/v1/sources/detect`, `POST /api/v1/sources/rss` |
| Source list | Status, last success/failure, enabled toggle, delete/archive action | `GET /api/v1/sources`, `PATCH /api/v1/sources/{source_id}` |
| Source detail | Detected metadata, recent jobs, recent normalized items, latest errors | `GET /api/v1/sources/{source_id}`, `GET /api/v1/ingestion/jobs` |
| Manual run | Trigger button, progress state, counters | `POST /api/v1/sources/{source_id}/ingest`, `GET /api/v1/ingestion/jobs/{job_id}` |
| Output preview | Table/JSON view for normalized items and candidate events | `GET /api/v1/public/items`, `GET /api/v1/public/events` |

Public output surfaces:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/public/items` | Paginated normalized feed items with source, canonical URL, title, summary, language, published time, extraction status, and geospatial hints. |
| `GET /api/v1/public/items/{item_id}` | Single normalized item with raw-source references and extraction metadata. |
| `GET /api/v1/public/events` | API-visible event candidates or approved events, filterable by country, category, date, risk, and bbox. |
| `GET /api/v1/public/export.json` | Download filtered items/events as JSON for downstream consumers. |
| `GET /api/v1/public/sources` | Public-safe source catalog without secrets or internal error details. |
| `GET /openapi.json` | Machine-readable public API contract for standalone integration. |

Standalone API requirements:

| Requirement | Design |
| --- | --- |
| Independent deployability | Keep data collection routes, schemas, migrations, workers, and environment variables independent enough to run as a separate FastAPI service. |
| Supabase boundary | API uses server-side Supabase Postgres credentials; browser clients never receive service-role keys. |
| Public read safety | Public endpoints return sanitized fields only and never expose raw private metadata, credentials, stack traces, or admin-only notes. |
| Output without frontend | Every collected item should be retrievable by API, export, or direct database read model. |
| API documentation | OpenAPI docs must show examples for adding feeds, triggering ingestion, polling jobs, and reading output. |
| Rate limits | Public endpoints use IP/API-key limits; admin ingestion endpoints require auth and stricter limits. |

### Source Configuration

Sources are stored in `external_sources`.

Key source fields:

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `connector_type` | `rss`, `news_api`, `dataset`, `government_alert`, `manual`. |
| `base_url` | Public endpoint, feed URL, API URL, or dataset location. |
| `auth_type` | `none`, `api_key`, `bearer`, `basic`, `signed_url`. |
| `secret_ref` | Environment or secret-manager key name, not the secret value. |
| `fetch_interval_minutes` | Recurring schedule interval. |
| `rate_limit_per_hour` | Source-specific request ceiling. |
| `reliability_score` | Decimal score from `0.00` to `1.00`. |
| `enabled` | Source can be paused without deletion. |
| `country_scope` | Optional country or region scope. |
| `category_scope` | Optional categories expected from the source. |
| `detected_title` | Feed title detected from RSS/Atom metadata. |
| `detected_site_url` | Canonical website URL linked from the feed. |
| `detected_feed_type` | `rss`, `atom`, or compatible feed format. |
| `detected_language` | Feed-level language hint when available. |
| `etag` | Last feed ETag for conditional requests. |
| `last_modified` | Last feed `Last-Modified` value for conditional requests. |

### Connector Types

| Connector | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| `RSSConnector` | Fetch RSS/Atom feeds, parse entries, respect ETag/Last-Modified, compute entry fingerprints. |
| `NewsAPIConnector` | Call news APIs with API key references, handle pagination, normalize provider errors, respect quotas. |
| `DatasetConnector` | Download or query CSV, JSON, or API datasets, detect file version changes, batch process records. |
| `GovernmentAlertConnector` | Fetch official advisories, alerts, bulletins, and emergency messages with high source reliability defaults. |
| `ManualConnector` | Accept analyst/admin-entered raw text or links as raw fetched items with explicit provenance. |

### Retry and Failure Handling

| Failure | Handling |
| --- | --- |
| Timeout | Retry with exponential backoff, then mark job partially failed. |
| HTTP 429 | Respect `Retry-After`, pause source until allowed, log rate-limit event. |
| HTTP 5xx | Retry up to configured limit and preserve failed response metadata. |
| Invalid payload | Store ingestion log with parser error; do not create normalized item. |
| Auth failure | Disable source after threshold and notify admins. |
| Network failure | Retry later; job remains failed but source stays enabled unless repeated threshold is exceeded. |

Duplicate raw entries are avoided with a `content_hash` and `source_item_id` unique strategy:

```text
unique(source_id, source_item_id) when source_item_id is present
unique(source_id, content_hash) for sources without stable item ids
```

Ingestion logs record job start, connector request metadata, status changes, retry count, fetched count, duplicate raw count, normalized count, pending-event count, failures, and duration.

### RSS/Atom Auto-Detection

The feed-add flow supports both direct feed URLs and website URLs.

Detection order:

| Step | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Validate URL | Accept only `http` and `https`; reject localhost, private IPs, link-local, metadata services, and unsupported schemes. |
| 2. Fetch headers | Use short timeout, size limits, redirect validation, and content-type checks. |
| 3. Parse direct feed | If response is RSS/Atom/XML, parse channel/feed metadata and sample entries. |
| 4. Discover feed links | If response is HTML, inspect `<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">` and Atom equivalents. |
| 5. Score candidates | Prefer valid feeds with recent entries, stable GUIDs, canonical links, and parseable published dates. |
| 6. Return preview | Show detected title, site URL, feed URL, language, latest item titles, update cadence, and warnings. |
| 7. Save source | Store selected feed URL and detection metadata only after user confirmation. |

Content extraction:

| Field | Detection |
| --- | --- |
| Canonical URL | Entry link, canonical HTML tag, or feed item URL. |
| Title | Feed entry title with HTML stripped and whitespace normalized. |
| Body | Entry content, summary, or fetched article body using a readability-style extractor. |
| Published time | Entry published/updated timestamp normalized to UTC. |
| Language | Feed language, article metadata, or text-language detection. |
| Image/media | Feed enclosures, Open Graph image, or article image metadata. |
| Location hints | Place names, country names, coordinates in metadata, and geocoding candidates. |
| Category hints | Feed categories, tags, keywords, and classifier output. |

## 5. Data Ingestion Pipeline

Pipeline stages:

| Stage | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Fetch raw data | Scheduler or manual trigger loads source config, acquires job lock, calls connector. |
| 2. Store raw fetched item | Persist original payload, source metadata, hash, fetch timestamp, and job id. |
| 3. Normalize fields | Convert source-specific fields into title, body, url, published_at, country hints, author, language, and media references. |
| 4. Extract event details | Extract incident title, category, actors, casualty hints, affected systems, summary, and event date. |
| 5. Extract location | Resolve country, admin area, place name, latitude, longitude, precision, and confidence. |
| 6. Extract category | Assign one or more categories such as war, border dispute, protest, terrorism, cyber attack, crisis, disaster, or instability. |
| 7. Generate AI summary | AI may summarize and structure text; failures do not block raw storage. |
| 8. Detect duplicate event | Compare fingerprint, title similarity, source URL, location proximity, category, and time window. |
| 9. Suggest risk level | Rule-based scorer suggests low, medium, or high with score breakdown. |
| 10. Suggest verification status | Verification service suggests status using source reliability and corroboration. |
| 11. Save pending event | Store event as `pending_review`, never directly published by AI. |
| 12. Send to review queue | Create assigned or unassigned queue item for analysts/admins. |
| 13. Publish after review | Analyst/admin approves, edits, merges, rejects, or marks false/disputed. |

AI is advisory only. It cannot publish, verify, delete, or archive events. Every AI output is stored in `ai_suggestions` and tied to the raw item, normalized item, event, and approving/rejecting user where applicable.

## 6. Database Design

Use Supabase Postgres with Alembic migrations and PostGIS enabled. Store `latitude` and `longitude` as `NUMERIC(9,6)` for simple projections and keep a `GEOGRAPHY(Point, 4326)` column on location tables for distance, bounding-box, and map queries.

Required Supabase extensions:

```sql
create extension if not exists postgis;
create extension if not exists pg_trgm;
create extension if not exists unaccent;
```

Supabase security boundary:

| Concern | Design |
| --- | --- |
| API database access | FastAPI uses server-side database credentials or Supabase service role in backend-only environment variables. |
| Browser access | The GeoAtlas source console calls FastAPI, not Supabase directly, unless a later read-only anon policy is deliberately added. |
| Public reads | Prefer FastAPI public endpoints for filtering, sanitization, rate limiting, and stable response contracts. |
| Row-level security | Enable RLS for tables exposed directly through Supabase; keep write tables service-only by default. |

## 7. Entity Relationship Explanation

One source can create many ingestion jobs through scheduled or manual triggers. One ingestion job can create many raw fetched items. Each raw fetched item can create one normalized item. One normalized item may become one event, or it may be ignored when it is duplicate, irrelevant, invalid, or below quality threshold.

One event can have many sources through `event_sources`, allowing source corroboration and reliability scoring. One event can have many timeline entries and locations. One user can have many watchlists, and each watchlist can include many country, category, keyword, actor, or event filters.

One intel cluster can contain many events through `cluster_events`. One event can have many AI suggestions, and AI suggestions remain auditable even when rejected. One event can have duplicate candidates against other events. Admin and analyst actions are written to immutable audit logs.

## 8. API Design

All routes are versioned under `/api/v1`. Responses use JSON. List endpoints support `page`, `page_size`, and relevant filters unless stated otherwise.

Common list response:

```json
{
  "items": [],
  "page": 1,
  "page_size": 25,
  "total": 0
}
```

## 9. Authentication and Authorization

Authentication design:

| Control | Design |
| --- | --- |
| Access token | JWT signed with strong secret or asymmetric key, short lifetime, contains subject, roles, permissions, and token id. |
| Refresh token | Opaque random token, stored hashed, rotated on each refresh, expires after configured period. |
| Password hashing | Argon2id preferred; bcrypt acceptable if Argon2id is unavailable. |
| RBAC | Route dependencies require permission codes; roles map to permission sets. |
| Account state | Disabled users cannot refresh tokens or call protected APIs. |
| Session revocation | Logout clears refresh token hash; password change revokes sessions. |

Permission matrix:

| Capability | guest | user | analyst | admin | superadmin |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| View public published events | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Create watchlists | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Save events | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| View dashboard user metrics | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| View ingestion data | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Trigger manual ingestion | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Review pending events | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Edit events | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Verify events | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Manage sources | No | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| Manage users | No | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| Assign roles | No | No | No | No | Yes |
| View audit logs | No | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| System settings | No | No | No | No | Yes |

## 10. Event Lifecycle

```text
Fetched Raw Item
  -> Normalized Item
  -> AI Suggested Event
  -> Pending Review
  -> Developing / Verified / Disputed / False
  -> Published
  -> Updated
  -> Archived
```

Lifecycle controls:

| Transition | Allowed Roles | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Raw item -> normalized item | System | Automatic pipeline. |
| Normalized item -> pending event | System | Created as `pending_review`; not public. |
| Pending event -> developing | analyst, admin, superadmin | Usually when credible but not fully confirmed. |
| Pending event -> verified | analyst, admin, superadmin | Requires source and confidence checks. |
| Pending event -> disputed | analyst, admin, superadmin | Used when credible reports conflict. |
| Pending event -> false | analyst, admin, superadmin | Stored for audit and duplicate suppression. |
| Pending event -> published | analyst, admin, superadmin | Requires review action. |
| Published -> updated | analyst, admin, superadmin | Creates audit log and may notify watchers. |
| Published -> archived | admin, superadmin | Soft archive with reason. |

## 11. Risk Scoring Design

Risk levels:

| Score | Level |
| --- | --- |
| `0-39` | Low |
| `40-69` | Medium |
| `70-100` | High |

Rule factors:

| Factor | Example Scoring |
| --- | --- |
| Casualties | `0-20` based on confirmed or reported casualty count. |
| Military involvement | `0-15` when state military, armed groups, or border forces are involved. |
| Cyber infrastructure impact | `0-15` for critical systems, national infrastructure, finance, health, or telecom. |
| Number of sources | `0-10` based on independent corroboration. |
| Official confirmation | `0-10` from government, emergency agency, court, or official military source. |
| Civilian harm | `0-15` for deaths, displacement, hostages, or blocked aid. |
| Geographic sensitivity | `0-10` for border zones, disputed territories, capitals, chokepoints, or sensitive infrastructure. |
| Escalation possibility | `0-10` based on actors, prior incidents, proximity, and rhetoric. |
| Source reliability | `-10` to `+10` based on reliability snapshot. |
| Social-media-only reports | `-15` penalty until corroborated. |
| Repetition in same region | `0-10` for recurring events in recent time window. |
| AI extraction confidence | `-10` to `+5`; low confidence reduces score, high confidence modestly supports it. |

Risk score is recalculated whenever sources, verification status, casualties, category, or location change. Manual overrides require reason and audit log.

## 12. Verification Workflow

Statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `unverified` | Insufficient corroboration or only one low-confidence source. |
| `developing` | Credible but still changing; details may be incomplete. |
| `verified` | Confirmed by reliable source(s) or strong independent corroboration. |
| `disputed` | Conflicting credible claims or contested facts. |
| `false` | Determined to be incorrect; retained for traceability and future duplicate suppression. |

Verification logic:

| Concern | Design |
| --- | --- |
| Fetched events | Enter review as pending with suggested verification status. |
| Source reliability | Higher reliability increases confidence but never bypasses review. |
| Multiple sources | Independent source corroboration improves verification score. |
| Admin/analyst approval | Required before status becomes public-facing verified or published. |
| Disputed information | Preserve competing claims in timeline or notes; mark status `disputed`. |
| False reports | Keep stored and archived from public feed unless admin views are requested. |
| Verification history | Store each status change in audit logs with before/after values, actor, reason, and timestamp. |

## 13. AI Integration Design

AI is an assistant layer. It suggests structured outputs that humans approve, reject, or edit.

AI can suggest:

| Suggestion | Output |
| --- | --- |
| Summary | Short event summary and longer analytical summary. |
| Category | Category slug with confidence and rationale. |
| Risk level | Risk level, score, and factor breakdown. |
| Verification status | Suggested status and corroboration reasoning. |
| Duplicate possibility | Candidate event ids and similarity reasons. |
| Timeline extraction | Ordered timeline entries. |

AI request flow:

```text
Service receives raw/normalized/event input
  -> Validate user role and input size
  -> Redact secrets and internal metadata
  -> Build prompt using versioned template
  -> Call AI provider with timeout and retry policy
  -> Validate response against schema
  -> Store suggestion in ai_suggestions
  -> Return suggestion id to analyst/admin
```

AI response format:

```json
{
  "summary": "Short factual summary.",
  "category": {
    "slug": "protest",
    "confidence": 0.83
  },
  "risk": {
    "level": "medium",
    "score": 61,
    "factors": [
      {"name": "civilian_harm", "points": 10},
      {"name": "source_reliability", "points": 6}
    ]
  },
  "locations": [
    {
      "country_name": "Exampleland",
      "place_name": "Capital City",
      "latitude": 12.345678,
      "longitude": 76.543210,
      "precision": "city",
      "confidence": 0.74
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.79
}
```

Safety rules:

| Rule | Enforcement |
| --- | --- |
| No auto-publication | AI service has no event publication method. |
| Structured output only | Responses validated against Pydantic schemas. |
| Prompt versioning | Every suggestion records prompt version and model name. |
| Secret protection | Source credentials and tokens are never sent to AI. |
| Low confidence handling | Low-confidence suggestions remain pending and flagged. |
| Rate limits | Redis counters and provider-specific backoff. |
| Failure handling | Store failure in ingestion logs; continue non-AI pipeline where possible. |
| Auditability | Store suggestion, input hash, confidence, reviewer decision, and timestamps. |

```

## 17. Error Handling

Standard error format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Event not found.",
    "details": {
      "event_id": "uuid"
    },
    "request_id": "req_123",
    "timestamp": "2026-06-16T10:15:00Z"
  }
}
```

Status mapping:

| Status | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `400 Bad Request` | Invalid business input or unsupported operation. |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing, expired, or invalid token. |
| `403 Forbidden` | Authenticated user lacks permission. |
| `404 Not Found` | Entity does not exist or is not visible to role. |
| `409 Conflict` | Duplicate source, duplicate raw item, merge conflict, stale update. |
| `422 Validation Error` | Pydantic validation failure. |
| `429 Rate Limit Exceeded` | API, auth, AI, or source-trigger rate exceeded. |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | Unexpected application failure. |
| `502 External Source Failure` | Connector received invalid or failed external response. |
| `503 Ingestion Service Unavailable` | Scheduler/job system unavailable or locked. |

## 18. Logging and Audit Trail

Structured application logs include `request_id`, `actor_user_id`, route, status code, duration, source id, job id, event id, and error details when applicable.

Audit events:

| Event | Storage |
| --- | --- |
| User login | Security log and audit log for admin-visible history. |
| Source creation/update | Audit before/after values. |
| Ingestion job started | Ingestion log. |
| Ingestion job failed | Ingestion log with retry metadata. |
| Raw item fetched | Ingestion counters and optional debug log. |
| Event extracted | Ingestion log and event creation audit. |
| Duplicate detected | Duplicate candidate row plus ingestion log. |
| Event creation | Audit log. |
| Event update | Audit before/after values. |
| Risk level change | Audit with reason and scorer details. |
| Verification change | Audit with reason and actor. |
| Source update | Audit before/after values. |
| Admin review action | Review queue decision and audit log. |
| AI suggestion generated | AI suggestion row and ingestion/API log. |

Audit logs are immutable. The application exposes append-only writes and read-only queries.

## 19. Security Design

| Area | Design |
| --- | --- |
| Password hashing | Argon2id with per-password salt and strong parameters. |
| JWT security | Short-lived access token, signed securely, includes token id, role claims, and issued-at timestamp. |
| Refresh tokens | Opaque, random, hashed at rest, rotated on refresh, revoked on logout/password change. |
| Rate limiting | Redis counters for auth, AI, source testing, manual ingestion, and high-cost endpoints. |
| CORS | Explicit allowed origins per environment; credentials only for trusted frontend domains. |
| Input validation | Pydantic schemas, enum constraints, strict length limits, URL validation. |
| SQL injection prevention | SQLAlchemy parameter binding; no string-concatenated SQL. |
| XSS prevention at API level | Store plain text or sanitized rich text; frontend escapes output; API rejects unsafe HTML fields unless explicitly allowed. |
| External URL validation | Allow only HTTP/HTTPS, block localhost/private networks for external fetchers, enforce DNS/IP checks. |
| SSRF protection | Deny private IP ranges, link-local addresses, metadata endpoints, redirects to blocked ranges, and unsupported schemes. |
| API keys | Stored outside code in environment or secret manager references. |
| Environment variables | Required at startup with strict validation. |
| Admin route protection | Permission dependency and audit logging. |
| Ingestion abuse prevention | Manual triggers rate-limited, role-gated, source-locked, and logged. |

## 20. Performance and Scalability

| Topic | Design |
| --- | --- |
| Indexing | Index high-cardinality filters: dates, risk, category, status, country, source, job, and full-text fields. |
| Pagination | Cursor pagination for live feed; page pagination for admin tables. |
| Caching | Cache dashboard aggregates, map marker clusters, source reliability stats, and common feed filters. |
| Query optimization | Use eager loading for event detail, projection queries for map markers, and aggregate materialization for dashboards. |
| Background jobs | Keep ingestion outside request latency; manual trigger returns job id. |
| Async processing | Use async HTTP clients for connectors and FastAPI request handling. |
| Map marker optimization | Return compact marker DTOs, bounding-box filters, clustering support, and risk/category filters. |
| Dashboard optimization | Precompute hourly/daily aggregates for high-traffic dashboards. |
| Source fetch control | Rate-limit per source, honor provider limits, and stagger schedules. |
| Batch inserts | Insert raw and normalized records in batches where connector responses are large. |
| Retry queues | Retry transient connector and AI failures with backoff. |
| Duplicate processing | Use hashes before expensive similarity checks; lock candidate processing per source/job. |

## 21. Deployment Design For Servers, VMs, And PaaS

Production deployment targets a VM, cloud instance, or PaaS runtime using Python virtual environments and managed services where possible.

Deployment components:

| Component | Design |
| --- | --- |
| Python environment | Create a virtual environment, install locked dependencies, run application as a non-root service user. |
| API process | Run Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers for FastAPI. |
| Reverse proxy | Nginx terminates HTTPS, forwards API traffic, sets proxy headers, and enforces body size limits. |
| Process manager | systemd service for API and separate service for scheduler/worker process. |
| Environment management | Store production variables in restricted env files or platform secret settings. |
| Database migrations | Run Alembic migrations during release before service restart. |
| PostgreSQL | Managed PostgreSQL preferred; self-hosted PostgreSQL acceptable with backups and monitoring. |
| Redis | Managed Redis or secured server Redis for cache, locks, and rate limits. |
| SSL/HTTPS | Use platform certificates or Certbot-managed certificates with renewal checks. |
| Domain | Point API subdomain to reverse proxy and configure allowed CORS origins. |
| CI/CD | Pull from GitHub, install dependencies, run tests, run migrations, restart services, verify health. |
| Health check | `/health` verifies API process, database connectivity, Redis connectivity, and scheduler heartbeat. |
| Log rotation | Rotate application, access, error, and scheduler logs. |
| Backups | Daily database backups, point-in-time recovery where supported, restore drills. |
| Rollback | Keep previous release directory and dependency lock; rollback code then run compatible migration plan. |
| Monitoring | Track latency, error rate, job failures, queue age, database health, and disk usage. |

Example systemd unit shape:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=GeoAtlas FastAPI service
After=network.target

[Service]
User=geoatlas
Group=geoatlas
WorkingDirectory=/opt/geo-atlas/current
EnvironmentFile=/etc/geo-atlas/production.env
ExecStart=/opt/geo-atlas/venv/bin/gunicorn app.main:app -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --workers 4 --bind 127.0.0.1:8000
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## 22. Scheduler and Background Jobs

Scheduler choice: APScheduler for the first production deployment because source schedules are interval-based, operationally simple, and can run as a dedicated service process. If ingestion volume grows substantially, move job execution to Celery or RQ while keeping the same service and repository boundaries.

Scheduler design:

| Concern | Design |
| --- | --- |
| Job registration | On scheduler startup, load enabled sources and register interval jobs using `fetch_interval_minutes`. |
| Manual fetch | API creates manual job and runner executes immediately if source lock is free. |
| Retry | Retry transient failures with exponential backoff; failed final state remains queryable. |
| Logging | Every job writes `ingestion_jobs` and detailed `ingestion_logs`. |
| Status tracking | Status transitions: `queued -> running -> success/partial_failure/failed/cancelled`. |
| Concurrent conflicts | Redis lock key `ingestion:source:{source_id}` prevents overlapping jobs for the same source. |
| Long-running jobs | Enforce job timeout, heartbeat updates, and cancellation markers. |
| Stale locks | Locks have TTL and heartbeat validation. |
| Admin visibility | Ingestion dashboard exposes active jobs, failure rate, queue age, and last success per source. |

## 23. Testing Strategy

| Test Type | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| Unit tests | Services, scoring rules, verification rules, URL safety, hashing, normalization helpers. |
| Integration tests | PostgreSQL repositories, transactions, Alembic migrations, Redis locks, cache invalidation. |
| API tests | Route validation, pagination, filters, error formats, response schemas. |
| Authentication tests | Register, login, refresh rotation, logout, disabled users, expired tokens. |
| Role permission tests | Ensure user, analyst, admin, and superadmin boundaries are enforced. |
| Database tests | Constraints, indexes, relationships, duplicate raw item prevention. |
| Ingestion pipeline tests | Source job to pending review flow with mocked connector data. |
| Source connector mock tests | RSS, news API, dataset, government alert, manual payloads. |
| AI service mock tests | Schema validation, timeout handling, rate limit handling, failed responses. |
| Deduplication tests | Hash match, title similarity, location/time proximity, false-positive rejection. |
| Review workflow tests | Approve, reject, edit-before-approval, merge duplicate, audit log generation. |
